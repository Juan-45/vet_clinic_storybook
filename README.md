# Project: Vet clinic storybook

Basic implementation of storybook with react to use in future projects

## Basic:

- I started from a basic sotrybook app. 
[Original repository](https://github.com/Juan-45/storybook_react)

It'll hold the layout components for a portfolio project, a Vet Clinic frontend. 

## Workflow. How to explore this repository?

- The master branch will hold ready for production code.
- The develop branch will hold already done features.
- Each main components, like footer, nav bar, etc, will be developed in its own branch. Each feature branch will be named as follow: "feature_" + featureName. Each feature branch will be merged against the develop branch.
- Any necessary fix to be made will be developed on a "hotFix" branch, which will be named as follow: "hotFix_" + bug + component. Each of this branches will be merged against the master branch.
